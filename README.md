StrategyDesignClock
===================

This is another example of the Strategy Design pattern, coded in C#. The user can select which format they want to display the time (analogue or digital), and change their choice while the clock is running. First you select "Analogue" or "Digital", then click the (only) button on the form to turn the clock on. After clocking the button, the text will change to "Turn Clock Off".
